# XML_Parser
Building a GUI in which the user can specify the location of an input XML file.
========================================================================================
XML is an abbreviation for Extensible Markup Langugage. It is method to break a document into a group of
tags, subtags, or contents. The syntax of an XML file represents a combination of tags that can reconstruct
a document of any sort.
The syntax must be followed to represent an XML file correctly. For that to be achieved, it is obligatory to
follow a certain arrangement through the following:

###• Formatting (Identation):
Identation is necessary for readability and comprehensibility. It is also important to remove irrelevant or
needless whitespaces.

###• Error Detection(and correction):
In order to achieve the previously mentioned standards: each open tag can be proceeded by multiple open
tags as long as the open tags are subsequently closed in the correct order, i.e the first occuring closed tag
must be lead by a similar open tag.

###• ToJson:
Json offers a lot of great features that are non‐existing in XML: it can be parsed by a standard
JavaScript function.

###• Compress/Decompress:
It’s required to reduce the size of large documents/XML files for larger
transfers.

###• Minify:
To save an amount of space in memory. It removes any extra spaces, or identations.

###• Graph representasion and analysis:
output a visualization graph of the social network and analyize the graph (most followed user , most connceted user , etc).

###• compare users:
(compares two users and outputs the mutual friends between them).

###• post search:
searches for a keyword and ouputs the post(s) where this keyword exists.
